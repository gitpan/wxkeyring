wxKeyring - Interface to GNU Keyring databases

This is a GUI (WxPerl) based program to consult GNU Keyring databases.
It provides read-only access. Although updating the database would be
possible, it requires special tools and techniques to synchronise with
the Palm handheld, and there are other tools for that.

Build & install as usual. Requires Palm::Keyring and Wx.
